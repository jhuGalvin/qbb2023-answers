# Step 2: Intersecting peaks
sample1 peaks retained: 36.5%
sample2 peaks retained: 27.8%

#Step 3: Visualizing the data with IGV
The peaks are fairly consistent between the two files, with most peaks matching and those which differ only in terms of magnitutde, not presence/absence of a peak. I do not think the p-value range is necessarily indicative of reproducibility, because different conditions can give very low p-values. Rather, p-values measure the error we see. We could probably get great p-values for almost any dataset if we applied the right methodology to it.
